    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=228):

    Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices vk (k = 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:     xk&nbsp;
     &nbsp;=   cos( 2k-1/n ×180° )    yk&nbsp; &nbsp;= &nbsp; sin( 2k-1/n ×180° )    Each Sn is to be interpreted as
    a filled shape consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior. The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two
    shapes S and T is the result of adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed
    coordinate-wise: (u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y). For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in
    pink below:    How many sides does S1864 + S1865 + … + S1909 have?
