    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=411):

    Let n be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates (x, y) = (2i mod n, 3i mod n) for 0 ≤
    i ≤ 2n. We will consider stations with the same coordinates as the same station.   We wish to form a path from
    (0, 0) to (n, n) such that the x and y coordinates never decrease. Let S(n) be the maximum number of stations
    such a path can pass through.   For example, if n = 22, there are 11 distinct stations, and a valid path can pass
     through at most 5 stations. Therefore, S(22) = 5. The case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal
     path:    It can also be verified that S(123) = 14 and S(10000) = 48.   Find ∑ S(k5) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 30.
