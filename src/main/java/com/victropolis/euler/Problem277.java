    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=277):

    A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value a1 in the following way:  an+1 = an/3
    if an is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large downward step, "D".  an+1 = (4an + 2)/3 if an divided by
     3 gives a remainder of 1. We shall denote this as an upward step, "U".   an+1 = (2an - 1)/3 if an divided by 3
     gives a remainder of 2. We shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".   The sequence terminates when some
     an = 1.   Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps. For instance if a1=231, then the sequence
     {an}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".   Of course, there are other
     sequences that begin with that same sequence "DdDddUUdDD....". For instance, if a1=1004064, then the sequence is
      DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD. In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a1 &gt; 106 that begins with the
      sequence DdDddUUdDD.   What is the smallest a1 &gt; 1015 that begins with the sequence
      "UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?
