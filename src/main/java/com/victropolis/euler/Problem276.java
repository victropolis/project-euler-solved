    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=276):

    Consider the triangles with integer sides a, b and c with a ≤ b ≤ c. An integer sided triangle (a,b,c) is called
    primitive if  gcd(a,b,c)=1.  How many primitive integer sided triangles exist with a perimeter not exceeding 10
    000 000?
