    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=355):

    Define Co(n) to be the maximal possible sum of a set of mutually co-prime elements from {1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,
    &nbsp;n}. For example Co(10) is 30 and hits that maximum on the subset {1,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;9}.   You
     are given that Co(30) = 193 and Co(100) = 1356.  Find Co(200000).
