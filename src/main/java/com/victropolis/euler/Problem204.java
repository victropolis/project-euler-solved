    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=204):

    A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger than 5. So the first few Hamming numbers
    are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15. There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 108. We will call a positive
     number a generalised Hamming number of type n, if it has no prime factor larger than n. Hence the Hamming
     numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5. How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are
     there which don't exceed 109?
