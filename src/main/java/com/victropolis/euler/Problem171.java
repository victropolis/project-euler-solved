    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=171):

    For a positive integer n, let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits (in base 10) of n, e.g. f(3) = 32 = 9,
     f(25) = 22 + 52 = 4 + 25 = 29, f(442) = 42 + 42 + 22 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36 Find the last nine digits of the sum of
     all n, 0 &lt; n &lt; 1020, such that f(n) is a perfect square.
