    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=202):

    Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with their reflective surfaces pointing
    inwards. There is an infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass. Label
    the vertices A, B and C. There are 2 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex C, bounce off 11 surfaces, then
    exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.    There are 80840 ways
    in which a laser beam may enter vertex C, bounce off 1000001 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex. In how
    many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex C, bounce off 12017639147 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?
