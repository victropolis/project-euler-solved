    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=216):

    Consider numbers t(n) of the form t(n) = 2n2-1 with n &gt; 1. The first such numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97,
    127 and 161. It turns out that only 49 = 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime. For n ≤ 10000 there are 2202 numbers t
    (n) that are prime. How many numbers t(n) are prime for n ≤ 50,000,000 ?
