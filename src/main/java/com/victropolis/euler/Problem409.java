    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=409):

    Let n be a positive integer. Consider nim positions where:  There are n non-empty piles.  Each pile has size less
     than 2n.  No two piles have the same size.    Let W(n) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the
     above conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2)
      = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and W(100) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007 = 384777056.  Find W(10&nbsp;
      000&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.
