    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=458):

    Consider the alphabet A made out of the letters of the word "project": A={c,e,j,o,p,r,t}. Let T(n) be the number
    of strings of length n consisting of letters from A that do not have a substring that is one of the 5040
    permutations of "project".  T(7)=7 7-7!=818503.   Find T(1012). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.
