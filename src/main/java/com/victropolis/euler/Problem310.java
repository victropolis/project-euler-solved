    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=310):

    Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square. Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the
    players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap. The number of stones in the three heaps is
    represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c). If 0≤a≤b≤c≤29 then the number of losing positions for the next player
    is 1160.   Find the number of losing positions for the next player if 0≤a≤b≤c≤100 000.
