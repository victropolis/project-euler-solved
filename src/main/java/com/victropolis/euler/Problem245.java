    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=245):

    We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the
    resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12)
     = 4⁄11.    The resilience of a number d &gt; 1 is then   φ( d)  d − 1  , where φ is Euler's totient function.
         We further define the coresilience of a number n &gt; 1 as C(n) =&nbsp;   n − φ(n)  n − 1  .       The
         coresilience of a prime p is C(p) =&nbsp;   1  p − 1  .    Find the sum of all composite integers 1 &lt; n ≤
          2×1011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction.
