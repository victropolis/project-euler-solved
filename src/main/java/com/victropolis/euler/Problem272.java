    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=272):

    For a positive number n, define C(n) as the number of the integers x, for which 1&lt;x&lt;n and x3≡1 mod n.
    When n=91, there are 8 possible values for x, namely : 9, 16, 22, 29, 53, 74, 79, 81. Thus, C(91)=8.  Find the
    sum of the positive numbers n≤1011 for which C(n)=242.
