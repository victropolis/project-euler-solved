    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=200):

    We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p2q3, where p and q are distinct primes. For example, 200 =
    5223 or 120072949 = 232613. The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500. Interestingly, 200 is also the
    first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers,
    prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008. Find the 200th
     prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".
