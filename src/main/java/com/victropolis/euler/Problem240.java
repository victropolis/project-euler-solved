    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=240):

    There are 1111 ways in which five 6-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 6) can be rolled so that the top three sum to
     15. Some examples are:  D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,6,3,5  D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,3,5,6  D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 3,3,3,6,6  D1,
     D2,D3,D4,D5 = 6,6,3,3,3  In how many ways can twenty 12-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 12) be rolled so that
     the top ten sum to 70?
