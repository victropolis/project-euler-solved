    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=273):

    Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b and N integer. For N=65 there are two solutions:
    a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7. We call S(N) the sum of the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = N, 0 ≤ a ≤ b, a, b
    and N integer. Thus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5. Find ∑S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by primes of the form 4k+1
     with 4k+1 &lt; 150.
