    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=170):

    Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854: 6 × 1273 = 7638 6 × 9854 = 59124 By concatenating
    these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 763859124. We will call 763859124 the "concatenated product of 6 and
    (1273,9854)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital. The
    same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers. What is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit concatenated
    product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a
     0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit number?
