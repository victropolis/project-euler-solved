    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=92):

    A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until
    it has been seen before. For example, 44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1 85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89
    Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that
    EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89. How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive
    at 89?
