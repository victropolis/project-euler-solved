    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=116):

    A row of five black square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from
     red (length two), green (length three), or blue (length four). If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven
     ways this can be done.
     &nbsp;    If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.                                     &nbsp;    And if
     blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.                           Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there
     are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of replacing the black tiles in a row measuring five units in length. How many different
      ways can the black tiles in a row measuring fifty units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at
       least one coloured tile must be used? NOTE: This is related to Problem 117.
