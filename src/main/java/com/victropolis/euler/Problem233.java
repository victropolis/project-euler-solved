    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=233):

    Let f(N) be the number of points with integer coordinates that are on a circle passing through (0,0), (N,0),(0,N)
    , and (N,N). It can be shown that f(10000) = 36. What is the sum of all positive integers N ≤ 1011 such that f(N)
     = 420 ?
