    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=166):

    A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9. It can be seen that in the grid  6 3 3 0 5 0 4 3 0 7 1 4 1 2 4 5
    the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12. In how many
    ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9 so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have
    the same sum?
