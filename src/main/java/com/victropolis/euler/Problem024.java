    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=24):

    A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits
    1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic
    order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are: 012&nbsp; &nbsp;021&nbsp; &nbsp;102&nbsp; &nbsp;
    120&nbsp; &nbsp;201&nbsp; &nbsp;210 What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
