    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=317):

    A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small
    fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.   We assume that
    the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s2.   Find the volume
    (in m3) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to
    four decimal places.
