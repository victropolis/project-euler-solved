    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=390):

    Consider the triangle with sides √5, √65 and √68. It can be shown that this triangle has area 9. S(n) is the sum
    of the areas of all triangles with sides √(1+b2), √(1+c2) and √(b2+c2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have
     an integral area not exceeding n. The example triangle has b=2 and c=8. S(106)=18018206. Find S(1010).
