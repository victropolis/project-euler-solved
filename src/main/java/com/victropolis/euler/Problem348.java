    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=348):

    Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way. Consider the
    palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4
    different ways. For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:
     22852 + 203 22232 + 663 18102 + 1253 11972 + 1563 Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
