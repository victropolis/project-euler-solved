    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=410):

    Let C be the circle with radius r, x2 + y2 = r2. We choose two points P(a, b) and Q(-a, c) so that the line
    passing through P and Q is tangent to C. For example, the quadruplet (r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7) satisfies this
    property. Let F(R, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (r, a, b, c) with this property, and with 0 &lt; r
     ≤ R and 0 &lt; a ≤ X. We can verify that F(1, 5) = 10, F(2, 10) = 52 and F(10, 100) = 3384. Find F(108, 109) + F
     (109, 108).
