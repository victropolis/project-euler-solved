    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=342):

    Consider the number 50. 502 = 2500 = 22 × 54, so φ(2500) = 2 × 4 × 53 = 8 × 53 = 23 × 53. 1 So 2500 is a square
    and φ(2500) is a cube.   Find the sum of all numbers n, 1 &lt; n &lt; 1010 such that φ(n2) is a cube.   1 φ
    denotes Euler's totient function.
