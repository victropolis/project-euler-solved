    The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact,
    there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way: 28 = 22 + 23 + 24 33 = 32 + 23 +
    24 49 = 52 + 23 + 24 47 = 22 + 33 + 24 How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a
