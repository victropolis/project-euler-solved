    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=510):

    Circles A and B are tangent to each other and to line L at three distinct points. Circle C is inside the space
    between A, B and L, and tangent to all three. Let rA, rB and rC be the radii of A, B and C respectively.     Let
    S(n)&nbsp;=&nbsp;Σ&nbsp;rA&nbsp;+&nbsp;rB&nbsp;+&nbsp;rC, for 0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;rA&nbsp;≤&nbsp;rB&nbsp;≤&nbsp;n
    where rA, rB and rC are integers. The only solution for 0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;rA&nbsp;≤&nbsp;rB&nbsp;≤&nbsp;5 is
    rA&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, rB&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and rC&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, so S(5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;
    =&nbsp;9. You are also given S(100)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3072. Find S(109).
