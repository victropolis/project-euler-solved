    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=341):

    The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n
    appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are      n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    10 11 12 13 14 15 …   G(n) 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 …      You are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137.
    You are also given that ΣG(n3) = 153506976 for 1 ≤ n &lt; 103. Find ΣG(n3) for 1 ≤ n &lt; 106.
