    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=145):

    Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal)
    digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409,
    and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or reverse(n). There are 120 reversible
    numbers below one-thousand. How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
