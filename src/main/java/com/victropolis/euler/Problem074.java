    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=74):

    The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145: 1! +
    4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers
    that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist: 169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
    871 → 45361 → 871 872 → 45362 → 872 It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get
    stuck in a loop. For example, 69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454) 78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871) 540 →
    145 (→ 145) Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain
    with a starting number below one million is sixty terms. How many chains, with a starting number below one
    million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?
