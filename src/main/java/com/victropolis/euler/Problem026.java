    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=26):

    A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2
     to 10 are given:     1/2 =&nbsp; 0.5   1/3 =&nbsp; 0.(3)   1/4 =&nbsp; 0.25   1/5 =&nbsp; 0.2   1/6 =&nbsp; 0.1
     (6)   1/7 =&nbsp; 0.(142857)   1/8 =&nbsp; 0.125   1/9 =&nbsp; 0.(1)   1/10 =&nbsp; 0.1     Where 0.1(6) means 0
     .166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle. Find the
     value of d &lt; 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
