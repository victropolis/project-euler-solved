    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=388):

    Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ N.   From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the
    other lattice points. Let D(N) be the number of distinct such lines.   You are given that D(1 000 000) =
    831909254469114121.   Find D(1010). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.
