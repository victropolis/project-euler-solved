    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=418):

    Let n be a positive integer. An integer triple (a, b, c) is called a factorisation triple of n if:   1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤
    c   a·b·c = n.     Define f(n) to be a + b + c for the factorisation triple (a, b, c) of n which minimises c / a.
     One can show that this triple is unique.   For example, f(165) = 19, f(100100) = 142 and f(20!) = 4034872.
     Find f(43!).
