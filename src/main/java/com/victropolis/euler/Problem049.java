    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=49):

    The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways:
    (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.
    There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there
     is one other 4-digit increasing sequence. What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in
     this sequence?
