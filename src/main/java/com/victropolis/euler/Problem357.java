    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=357):

    Consider the divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. It can be seen that for every divisor d of 30, d+30/d is prime.
      Find the sum of all positive integers n not exceeding 100 000 000such that for every divisor d of n, d+n/d is
      prime.
