    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=466):

    Let P(m,n) be the number of distinct terms in an m×n multiplication table. For example, a 3×4 multiplication
    table looks like this:      × 1 2 3 4   1 1 2 3 4   2 2 4 6 8   3 3 6 9 12      There are 8 distinct terms {1,2,
    3,4,6,8,9,12}, therefore P(3,4) = 8. You are given that: P(64,64) = 1263, P(12,345) = 1998, and P(32,1015) =
    13826382602124302. Find P(64,1016).
