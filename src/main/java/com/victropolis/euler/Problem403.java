    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=403):

    For integers a and b, we define D(a, b) as the domain enclosed by the parabola y = x2 and the line y = a·x + b: D
    (a, b) = { (x, y) | x2 ≤ y ≤ a·x + b }.   L(a, b) is defined as the number of lattice points contained in D(a, b)
    . For example, L(1, 2) = 8 and L(2, -1) = 1.   We also define S(N) as the sum of L(a, b) for all the pairs (a, b)
     such that the area of D(a, b) is a rational number and |a|,|b| ≤ N. We can verify that S(5) = 344 and S(100) =
     26709528.   Find S(1012). Give your answer mod 108.
