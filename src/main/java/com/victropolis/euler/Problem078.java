    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=78):

    Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five
    coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.     OOOOO   OOOO&nbsp; &nbsp;O
    OOO&nbsp; &nbsp;OO   OOO&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O   OO&nbsp; &nbsp;OO&nbsp; &nbsp;O   OO&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp;
    &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O   O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O     Find the least value of n
    for which p(n) is divisible by one million.
