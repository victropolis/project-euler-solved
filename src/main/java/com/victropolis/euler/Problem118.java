    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=118):

    Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be
     formed. Interestingly with the set {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime. How many
     distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?
