    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=476):

    Let R(a, b, c) be the maximum area covered by three non-overlapping circles inside a triangle with edge lengths
    a, b and c. Let S(n) be the average value of R(a, b, c) over all integer triplets (a, b, c) such that 1&nbsp;
    ≤&nbsp;a&nbsp;≤&nbsp;b&nbsp;≤&nbsp;c&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;≤&nbsp;n You are given S(2) = R(1, 1, 1)
     ≈ 0.31998, S(5) ≈ 1.25899. Find S(1803) rounded to 5 decimal places behind the decimal point.
