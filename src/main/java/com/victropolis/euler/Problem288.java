    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=288):

    For any prime p the number N(p,q) is defined by N(p,q) = âˆ‘n=0 to q Tn*pn with Tn generated by the following
    random number generator:  S0 = 290797 Sn+1 = Sn2 mod 50515093 Tn = Sn mod p   Let Nfac(p,q) be the factorial of N
    (p,q). Let NF(p,q) be the number of factors p in Nfac(p,q).   You are given that NF(3,10000) mod 320=624955285.
     Find NF(61,107) mod 6110
