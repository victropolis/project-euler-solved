    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=454):

    In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.       1  x   +    1  y   =    1  n      For a limit
    L we define F(L) as the number of solutions which satisfy x &lt; y â‰¤ L. We can verify that F(15) = 4 and F(1000)
    = 1069. Find F(1012).
