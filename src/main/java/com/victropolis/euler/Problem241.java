    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=241):

    For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.  A perfect
     number, as you probably know, is a number with σ(n) = 2n.    Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive
      integer as p(n) =&nbsp;   σ(n)  n  .    Find the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 1018 for which p(n) has the
      form k + 1⁄2, where k is an integer.
