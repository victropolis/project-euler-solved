    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=108):

    In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.       1  x   +    1  y   =    1  n      For n = 4
    there are exactly three distinct solutions:       1  5   +    1  20   =    1  4      1  6   +    1  12   =    1
    4      1  8   +    1  8   =    1  4      What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
    exceeds one-thousand? NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly advised that you
    solve this one first.
