    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=226):

    The blancmange curve is the set of points (x,y) such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and  ,where s(x) = the distance from x to the
     nearest integer. The area under the blancmange curve is equal to ½, shown in pink in the diagram below.    Let C
      be the circle with centre (¼,½) and radius ¼, shown in black in the diagram. What area under the blancmange
      curve is enclosed by C?Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh
