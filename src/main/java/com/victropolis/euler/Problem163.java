    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=163):

    Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex to the middle of the opposite
     side, such as in the size 1 triangle in the sketch below.    Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size
      or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles as building blocks,
      larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2 triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles
       of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that size 2 triangle. It
       can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle building blocks. A size 3 triangle would
       contain 9 size 1 triangle building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n2 size 1 triangle building
        blocks. If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size n, then T(1) = 16 T(2) =
        104 Find T(36).
