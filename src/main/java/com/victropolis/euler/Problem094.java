    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=94):

    It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However,
    the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units. We shall define an almost equilateral
    triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit. Find the
    sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose
    perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).
