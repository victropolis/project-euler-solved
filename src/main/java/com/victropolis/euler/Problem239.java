    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=239):

    A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random order. What is the probability that we have
    a partial derangement such that exactly 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions? (Any
    number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.) Give your answer rounded to 12
     places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.
