    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=229):

    Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because  3600 = 48 2 + &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;36 2   3600 = 20 2 + 2×40
     2   3600 = 30 2 + 3×30 2   3600 = 45 2 + 7×15 2    Similarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2×542 =
     2832 + 3×522 = 1972 + 7×842. In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares. We
     are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:  n = a1 2 +
     &nbsp; b1 2   n = a2 2 + 2 b2 2   n = a3 2 + 3 b3 2   n = a7 2 + 7 b7 2,  where the ak and bk are positive
     integers. There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107. How many such numbers are there that do not
     exceed 2×109?
