    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=132):

    A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k. For
    example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11×41×271×9091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414. Find the sum of the
    first forty prime factors of R(109).
