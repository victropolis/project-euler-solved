    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=218):

    Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25. The area of this triangle is 84, which is
    divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28. Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd
    (b,c)=1. Also c is a perfect square. We will call a right angled triangle perfect if -it is a primitive right
    angled triangle -its hypotenuse is a perfect square We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if -it is
    a perfect right angled triangle and -its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.  How many perfect
    right-angled triangles with câ‰¤1016 exist that are not super-perfect?
