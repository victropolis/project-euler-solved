    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=421):

    Numbers of the form n15+1 are composite for every integer n &gt; 1. For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be
    defined as the sum of the distinct prime factors of n15+1 not exceeding m.  E.g. 2 15+1 = 3×3×11×331.  So s(2,10)
     = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.   Also 10 15+1 = 7×11×13×211×241×2161×9091.  So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,
     1000) = 483.    Find ∑ s(n,108) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1011.
