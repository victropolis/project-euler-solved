    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=362):

    Consider the number 54. 54 can be factored in 7 distinct ways into one or more factors larger than 1: 54, 2×27,
    3×18, 6×9, 3×3×6, 2×3×9 and 2×3×3×3. If we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain:
    3×3×6 and 2×3×3×3.   Let's call Fsf(n) the number of ways n can be factored into one or more squarefree factors
    larger than 1, so Fsf(54)=2.   Let S(n) be ∑Fsf(k) for k=2 to n.   S(100)=193.   Find S(10 000 000 000).
