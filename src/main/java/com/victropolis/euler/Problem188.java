    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=188):

    The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer b, denoted by a↑↑b or ba, is recursively
     defined by: a↑↑1 = a, a↑↑(k+1) = a(a↑↑k).  Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 33 = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 327 = 7625597484987
     and 3↑↑4 is roughly 103.6383346400240996*10^12. Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.
