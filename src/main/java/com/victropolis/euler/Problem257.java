    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=257):

    Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a ≤ b ≤ c. (AB = c, BC = a and AC = b). The angular bisectors
    of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).       The segments EF, EG and FG
    partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG. It can be proven that for each of
    these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational. However, there exist triangles for which
    some or all of these ratios are integral.   How many triangles ABC with perimeter≤100,000,000 exist so that the
    ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?
