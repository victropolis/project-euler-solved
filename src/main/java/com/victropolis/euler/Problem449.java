    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=449):

    Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an
    ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation: b2x2 + b2y2 + a2z2 = a2b2.   Phil wants to know how much
    chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.     If a=1
    mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is      28   3     π mm3    If a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of
    chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm 3.   Find the amount of chocolate in mm3 required if a=3 mm
    and b=1 mm. Give your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.
