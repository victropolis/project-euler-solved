    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=104):

    The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:  F n = F n−1 + F n−2, where F 1 = 1 and F 2 = 1.
    It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits
    are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575
    digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital. Given that Fk is the
    first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
