    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=401):

    The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6. The sum of the squares of these numbers is 1+4+9+36=50.   Let sigma2(n)
    represent the sum of the squares of the divisors of n. Thus sigma2(6)=50.  Let SIGMA2 represent the summatory
    function of sigma2, that is SIGMA2(n)=âˆ‘sigma2(i) for i=1 to n.  The first 6 values of SIGMA2 are: 1,6,16,37,63
    and 113.   Find SIGMA2(1015) modulo 109.
