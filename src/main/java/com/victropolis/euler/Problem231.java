    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=231):

    The binomial coefficient 10C3 = 120. 120 = 23 × 3 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5, and 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14. So the sum
     of the terms in the prime factorisation of 10C3 is 14.  Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of
     20000000C15000000.
