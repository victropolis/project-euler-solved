    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=286):

    Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when
    shooting from a distance x is exactly (1 -&nbsp;x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50. During each
    practice run, she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = 50 and, according to her records, she has
    precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20 points. Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal
    places.
