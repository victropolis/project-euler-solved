    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=205):

    Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. Colin has six six-sided (cubic)
    dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest
    total wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal. What is the probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic
     Colin? Give your answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg
