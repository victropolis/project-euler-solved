    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=408):

    Let's call a lattice point (x, y) inadmissible if x, y and x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y are all positive perfect squares. For
    example, (9, 16) is inadmissible, while (0, 4), (3, 1) and (9, 4) are not. Consider a path from point (x1, y1) to
     point (x2, y2) using only unit steps north or east. Let's call such a path admissible if none of its
     intermediate points are inadmissible. Let P(n) be the number of admissible paths from (0, 0) to (n, n). It can
     be verified that P(5) = 252, P(16) = 596994440 and P(1000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007 = 341920854. Find P
     (10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.
