    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=304):

    For any positive integer n the function next_prime(n) returns the smallest prime p  such that p&gt;n.   The
    sequence a(n) is defined by: a(1)=next_prime(1014) and a(n)=next_prime(a(n-1)) for n&gt;1.    The fibonacci
    sequence f(n) is defined by: f(0)=0, f(1)=1 and f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for n&gt;1.   The sequence b(n) is defined as
    f(a(n)).   Find ∑b(n) for 1≤n≤100 000. Give your answer mod 1234567891011.
