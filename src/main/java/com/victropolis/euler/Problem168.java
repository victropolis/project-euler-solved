    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=168):

    Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it,
    giving us 714285. It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857. This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is
     a divisor of its right-rotation. Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 &lt; n &lt; 10100, that
      have this property.
