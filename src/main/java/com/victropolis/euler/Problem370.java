    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=370):

    Let us define a geometric triangle as an integer sided triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c so that its sides form a
    geometric progression, i.e. b2&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;·&nbsp;c&nbsp;.&nbsp; An example of such a geometric triangle
    is the triangle with sides a = 144, b = 156 and c = 169. There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter ≤
    106 . How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter ≤ 2.5·1013 ?
