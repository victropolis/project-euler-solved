    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=292):

    We shall define a pythagorean polygon to be a convex polygon with the following properties:   there are at least
    three vertices, no three vertices are aligned, each vertex has integer coordinates, each edge has integer length.
       For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is
       ≤ n. Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another. You are
       given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045. Find P(120).
