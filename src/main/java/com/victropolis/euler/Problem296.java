    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=296):

    Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with BC ≤ AC ≤ AB. k is the angular bisector of angle ACB. m is the
    tangent at C to the circumscribed circle of ABC. n is a line parallel to m through B. The intersection of n and k
     is called E.      How many triangles ABC with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such that BE has integral
     length?
