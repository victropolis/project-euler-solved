    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=122):

    The most naive way of computing n15 requires fourteen multiplications: n × n × ... × n = n15 But using a "binary"
     method you can compute it in six multiplications: n × n = n2 n2 × n2 = n4 n4 × n4 = n8 n8 × n4 = n12 n12 × n2 =
     n14 n14 × n = n15 However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications: n × n = n2 n2 × n = n3
     n3 × n3 = n6 n6 × n6 = n12 n12 × n3 = n15 We shall define m(k) to be the minimum number of multiplications to
     compute nk; for example m(15) = 5. For 1 ≤ k ≤ 200, find ∑ m(k).
