    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=519):

    An arrangement of coins in one or more rows with the bottom row being a block without gaps and every coin in a
    higher row touching exactly two coins in the row below is called a fountain of coins. Let f(n) be the number of
    possible fountains with n coins. For 4 coins there are three possible arrangements:    Therefore f(4)&nbsp;
    =&nbsp;3 while f(10)&nbsp;=&nbsp;78. Let T(n) be the number of all possible colorings with three colors for all f
    (n) different fountains with n coins, given the condition that no two touching coins have the same color. Below
    you see the possible colorings for one of the three valid fountains for 4 coins:    You are given that T(4)&nbsp;
    =&nbsp;48 and T(10)&nbsp;=&nbsp;17760. Find the last 9 digits of T(20000).
