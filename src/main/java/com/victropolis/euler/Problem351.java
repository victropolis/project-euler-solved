    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=351):

    A hexagonal orchard of order n is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side n.
    The following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:       Highlighted in green are the points which
    are hidden from the center by a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30
    points are hidden from the center.   Let H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal
    orchard of order n.   H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.   Find H(100 000 000).
