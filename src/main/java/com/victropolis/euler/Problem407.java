    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=407):

    If we calculate a2 mod 6 for 0 ≤ a ≤ 5 we get: 0,1,4,3,4,1.   The largest value of a such that a2 ≡ a mod 6 is 4.
     Let's call M(n) the largest value of a &lt; n such that a2 ≡ a (mod n). So M(6) = 4.   Find ∑M(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 107.
