    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=420):

    A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers. Some positive integer matrices
    can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:     We
    define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a trace less than N and which can be
    expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F
    (1000) = 1019.   Find F(107).
