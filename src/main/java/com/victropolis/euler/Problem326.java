    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=326):

    Let an be a sequence recursively defined by: .   So the first 10 elements of an are: 1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9.  Let f
    (N,M) represent the number of pairs (p,q) such that:       It can be seen that f(10,10)=4 with the pairs (3,3),
    (5,5), (7,9) and (9,10).   You are also given that f(104,103)=97158.  Find f(1012,106).
