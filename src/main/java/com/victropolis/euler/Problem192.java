    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=192):

    Let x be a real number. A best approximation to x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s in reduced
     form, with s ≤ d, such that any rational number which is closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d:
     | p/ q- x| &lt; | r/ s- x| ⇒ q &gt; d  For example, the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 20
     is 18/5 and the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 30 is 101/28. Find the sum of all
     denominators of the best approximations to √n for the denominator bound 1012, where n is not a perfect square
     and 1 &lt; n ≤ 100000.
