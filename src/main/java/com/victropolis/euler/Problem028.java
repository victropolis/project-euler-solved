    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=28):

    Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
     21 22 23 24 25 20 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;8 &nbsp;9 10 19 &nbsp;6 &nbsp;1 &nbsp;2 11 18 &nbsp;5 &nbsp;4 &nbsp;3 12 17 16
     15 14 13 It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the sum of the numbers
     on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
