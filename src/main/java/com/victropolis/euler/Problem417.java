    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=417):

    A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2
     to 10 are given:     1/2 =&nbsp; 0.5   1/3 =&nbsp; 0.(3)   1/4 =&nbsp; 0.25   1/5 =&nbsp; 0.2   1/6 =&nbsp; 0.1
     (6)   1/7 =&nbsp; 0.(142857)   1/8 =&nbsp; 0.125   1/9 =&nbsp; 0.(1)   1/10 =&nbsp; 0.1     Where 0.1(6) means 0
     .166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.  Unit
     fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring
     cycle. We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0.   Let L(n) denote the length of
      the recurring cycle of 1/n. You are given that ∑L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.   Find ∑L(n) for
       3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 000
