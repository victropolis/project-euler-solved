    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=278):

    Given the values of integers 1 &lt; a1 &lt; a2 &lt;... &lt; an, consider the linear combination q1a1 + q2a2 + ...
     + qnan = b, using only integer values qk ≥ 0.   Note that for a given set of ak, it may be that not all values
     of b are possible. For instance, if a1 = 5 and a2 = 7, there are no q1 ≥ 0 and q2 ≥ 0 such that b could be 1, 2,
      3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 or 23.  In fact, 23 is the largest impossible value of b for a1 = 5 and a2 = 7.
      We therefore call f(5, 7) = 23. Similarly, it can be shown that f(6, 10, 15)=29 and f(14, 22, 77) = 195.   Find
       ∑ f(p*q,p*r,q*r), where p, q and r are prime numbers and p &lt; q &lt; r &lt; 5000.
