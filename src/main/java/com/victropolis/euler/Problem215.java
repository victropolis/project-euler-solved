    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=215):

    Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2×1 and 3×1 bricks (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for
     extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never
     form a "running crack". For example, the following 9×3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in
     red:    There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9×3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8. Calculate W(32,10).
