    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=266):

    The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12. The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is
     3. We shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the square root of n the pseudo square
      root (PSR) of n. It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.   Let p be the product of the primes below 190. Find PSR(p)
      mod 1016.
