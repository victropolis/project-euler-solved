    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=442):

    An integer is called eleven-free if its decimal expansion does not contain any substring representing a power of
    11 except 1. For example, 2404 and 13431 are eleven-free, while 911 and 4121331 are not. Let E(n) be the nth
    positive eleven-free integer. For example, E(3) = 3, E(200) = 213 and E(500&nbsp;000) = 531563. Find E(1018).
