    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=110):

    In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.       1  x   +    1  y   =    1  n      It can be
    verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total
     number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred. What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct
     solutions exceeds four million? NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of Problem 108 and as it is
     well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
