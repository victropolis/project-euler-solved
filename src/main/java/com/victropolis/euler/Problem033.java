    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=33):

    The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may
    incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s. We shall consider
    fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples. There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of
    fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator. If the product of
    these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.
