    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=178):

    Consider the number 45656.  It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a difference of one.
      A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.  A
      pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.  How many pandigital step numbers
      less than 10 40 are there?
