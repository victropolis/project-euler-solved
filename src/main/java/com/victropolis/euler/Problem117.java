    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=117):

    Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red tiles measuring two units, green
    tiles measuring three units, and blue tiles measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five
    units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.
                                                                                                                      &nbsp;    How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled? NOTE: This is related to Problem 116.
