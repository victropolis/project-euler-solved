    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=203):

    The binomial coefficients nCk can be arranged in triangular form, Pascal's triangle, like this:      1     1  1
       1  2  1     1  3  3  1     1  4  6  4  1     1  5  10  10  5  1     1  6  15  20  15  6  1    1  7  21  35  35
         21  7  1    .........  It can be seen that the first eight rows of Pascal's triangle contain twelve distinct
          numbers: 1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;6,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;15,&nbsp;20,&nbsp;21&nbsp;
          and&nbsp;35. A positive integer n is called squarefree if no square of a prime divides n. Of the twelve
          distinct numbers in the first eight rows of Pascal's triangle, all except 4 and 20 are squarefree. The sum
          of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first eight rows is 105. Find the sum of the distinct squarefree
          numbers in the first 51 rows of Pascal's triangle.
