    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=190):

    Let Sm = (x1, x2, ... , xm) be the m-tuple of positive real numbers with x1 + x2 + ... + xm = m for which Pm = x1
     * x22 * ... * xmm is maximised. For example, it can be verified that [P10] = 4112 ([ ] is the integer part
     * function). Find Σ[Pm] for 2 ≤ m ≤ 15.
