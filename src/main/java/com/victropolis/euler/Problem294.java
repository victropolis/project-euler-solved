    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=294):

    For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation. Thus d
    (42) = 4+2 = 6.   For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k &lt; 10n with the
    following properties :   k is divisible by 23 and  d(k) = 23.    You are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) =
    6377168878570056.   Find S(1112) and give your answer mod 109.
