    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=173):

    We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical
    and horizontal symmetry. For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square
    laminae:    With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time, it is possible to
    form forty-one different square laminae. Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be
    formed?
