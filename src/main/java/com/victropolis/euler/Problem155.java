    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=155):

    An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.  The capacitors can be connected
    in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other
    capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit. Using this simple
    procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances.
    For example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance
    values:     If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to n
     equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ... Find D(18)
     . Reminder : When connecting capacitors C1, C2 etc in parallel, the total capacitance is CT&nbsp;=&nbsp;C1&nbsp;
     +&nbsp;C2&nbsp;+...,  whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:
