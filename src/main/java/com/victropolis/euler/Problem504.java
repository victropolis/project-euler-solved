    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=504):

    Let ABCD be a quadrilateral whose vertices are lattice points lying on the coordinate axes as follows: A(a, 0), B
    (0, b), C(−c, 0), D(0, −d), where 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ m and a, b, c, d, m are integers. It can be shown that for m =
     4 there are exactly 256 valid ways to construct ABCD. Of these 256 quadrilaterals, 42 of them strictly contain a
      square number of lattice points. How many quadrilaterals ABCD strictly contain a square number of lattice
      points for m = 100?
