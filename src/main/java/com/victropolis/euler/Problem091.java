    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=91):

    The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to
     form ΔOPQ.     There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each
     co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 2.     Given that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤
     50, how many right triangles can be formed?
