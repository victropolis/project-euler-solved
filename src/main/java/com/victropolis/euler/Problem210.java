    Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=210):

    Consider the set S(r) of points (x,y) with integer coordinates satisfying |x| + |y| ≤ r.  Let O be the point (0,
    0) and C the point (r/4,r/4).  Let N(r) be the number of points B in S(r), so that the triangle OBC has an obtuse
     angle, i.e. the largest angle α satisfies 90°&lt;α&lt;180°.  So, for example, N(4)=24 and N(8)=100.  What is N
     (1,000,000,000)?
