Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=131):

There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a
perfect cube. For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123. What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with
 this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred. How many primes below
  one million have this remarkable property?
