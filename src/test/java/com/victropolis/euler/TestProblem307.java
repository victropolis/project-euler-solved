Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=307):

k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects
may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).   Let p(k,n) represent the probability
that there is a chip with at least 3 defects. For instance p(3,7) â‰ˆ 0.0204081633.   Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and
give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij
