Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=56):

A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one
followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1. Considering
natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b &lt; 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
