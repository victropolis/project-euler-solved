Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=516):

5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5. 5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming
numbers. Let S(L) be the sum of the numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's totient function Ï†(n) is a Hamming
number. S(100)=3728.   Find S(1012). Give your answer modulo 232.
