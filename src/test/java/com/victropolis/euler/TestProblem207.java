Description (from https://projecteuler.net/problem=207):

For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the form&nbsp;&nbsp; 4t = 2t + k, where 4t, 2t,
and k are all positive integers and t is a real number. The first two such partitions are 41 = 21 + 2 and 41
.5849625... = 21.5849625... + 6. Partitions where t is also an integer are called perfect. For any m ≥ 1 let P(m) be
the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with k ≤ m. Thus P(6) = 1/2. In the following table are listed
some values of P(m) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(5) = 1/1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(10) = 1/2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(15) = 2/3 &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;P(20) = 1/2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(25) = 1/2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(30) = 2/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;P(180) = 1/4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(185) = 3/13 Find the smallest m for which P(m) &lt; 1/12345
